# ClosestDivisors
C++ program to find the N closest divisors of a number

Fun little side project I did in a few hours.<br>
Finds the set of numbers such that X = a * b * c ... * d<br>
where it's factors are closest<br>
<br>
works by getting the prime factors of the number, sorting and then multiplying the smallest and biggest numbers on the list.
